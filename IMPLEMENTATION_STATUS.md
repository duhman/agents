# Visual Agent Builder - Implementation Status

## Completed

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
Created complete database schema for the agent builder with the following tables:
- `agent_workflows`: Store workflow definitions with nodes, edges, and configuration
- `agent_executions`: Track workflow execution history and status

  - Full agent configuration (name, model, temperature, maxTokens, topP)
  - Tool definitions with Zod schemas
  - Structured output support
  - Error handling
- MCP tool calling framework with getMCPClient method
- State management and context variables
- Execution trace tracking
- Error handling and logging

### 7. Node Type Implementations âœ…
Handlers implemented for core node types:
- **Trigger Nodes**: Manual triggers (webhook/cron planned)
- **OpenAI Agent Nodes**: Full Agent SDK configuration with tools
- **MCP Tool Nodes**: Server selection and tool execution
- **Control Flow**: Condition nodes with true/false branching
- **Slack Approval**: Human-in-the-loop integration
- **HTTP Request**: External API calls
- **Transform**: Data transformation with JavaScript

## Planned Next Steps

### 8. Enhanced Agent Execution (High Priority)
Complete full OpenAI Agent SDK integration:
- Real agent execution (currently returns placeholder data)
- Streaming responses
- Tool calling with actual execution
- Agent handoffs between multiple agents
- Token usage tracking and cost monitoring

### 9. Real MCP Integration (High Priority)
Implement actual MCP server connections:
- Connect to real MCP servers (currently uses stub client)
- OAuth authentication flows
- Tool discovery and schema introspection
- Real-time tool execution
- Error handling and retries

### 10. Continuous Execution
Implement background job processing:
- Cron scheduler for scheduled triggers
- Webhook endpoint handler with URL generation
- Event subscription system
- Job queue with Bull/BullMQ
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 11. Advanced Features
- **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow templates
- **Import/Export**: Save and share workflows as JSON
- **Version Control**: Workflow versioning and history
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Analytics and performance metrics
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user editing and permissions

### 12. Integration & Testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- MCP server integration testing
- Slack approval flow testing
- Performance optimization
- Load testing for concurrent executions

- Leverages `@agents/core` utilities (PII masking, logging, validation)
- Uses existing Slack integration from `apps/slack-bot`
- Follows established architectural patterns
- Compatible with current OpenAI agent implementations

## Success Metrics

- **Usability**: Create first workflow in <10 minutes
- **Performance**: Execute simple flows in <5 seconds
- **Reliability**: >99% execution success rate
- **Adoption**: 50+ active workflows within 3 months
