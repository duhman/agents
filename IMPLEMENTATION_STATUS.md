# Visual Agent Builder - Implementation Status

## Completed

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
Created complete database schema for the agent builder with the following tables:
- `agent_workflows`: Store workflow definitions with nodes, edges, and configuration
- `agent_executions`: Track workflow execution history and status
- `agent_triggers`: Manage webhook, cron, and event triggers
- `agent_approvals`: Handle human-in-the-loop Slack approvals

All tables have been successfully created in the PostgreSQL database with proper relationships and indexes.

### 2. Repository Functions âœ…
Implemented comprehensive CRUD operations in `packages/db/src/repositories.ts`:
- Workflow management (create, update, get, list, delete)
- Execution tracking (create, update, get, list)
- Trigger configuration (create, update, get, list, delete)
- Approval management (create, update, get, list pending)

### 3. Design Document âœ…
Created detailed architecture document (`AGENT_BUILDER_DESIGN.md`) covering:
- Node types (Trigger, Action, Control Flow, Human-in-the-Loop, Data Transformation)
- API endpoints
- Technology stack
- Security considerations
- Implementation phases

## In Progress

### 4. Frontend Application ðŸ”„
Started scaffolding the React-based visual agent builder UI:
- Created package.json with dependencies (React Flow, React Query, Zustand)
- TypeScript configuration
- Will include:
  - Visual flow editor with drag-and-drop
  - Node library with all node types
  - Real-time execution monitoring
  - Configuration panels

## Planned Next Steps

### 5. Backend API (High Priority)
Create Fastify-based API server with endpoints for:
- Workflow CRUD operations (`/api/workflows/*`)
- Execution management (`/api/executions/*`)
- Trigger configuration (`/api/triggers/*`)
- MCP integration (`/api/mcp/*`)
- Approval handling (`/api/approvals/*`)

### 6. Execution Engine (Critical)
Implement the core workflow execution engine:
- Node-based workflow interpreter
- OpenAI Agent SDK integration
- MCP tool calling support
- State management and persistence
- Error handling and retry logic

### 7. Node Type Implementations
Build handlers for each node type:
- **Trigger Nodes**: Webhook, Schedule, Email, Event, Manual
- **OpenAI Agent Nodes**: Full Agent SDK configuration
- **MCP Tool Nodes**: Dynamic tool discovery and execution
- **Control Flow**: Condition, Loop, Merge, Switch, Wait
- **Slack Approval**: Human-in-the-loop with Slack integration

### 8. Continuous Execution
Implement background job processing:
- Cron scheduler for scheduled triggers
- Webhook endpoint handler
- Event subscription system
- Job queue with Bull/BullMQ

### 9. Frontend Components
Complete the React UI:
- Flow canvas with React Flow
- Node palette and drag-and-drop
- Node configuration panels
- Execution trace viewer
- Real-time status updates
- Template library

### 10. Integration & Testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- MCP server integration testing
- Slack approval flow testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## Architecture Highlights

### Visual Flow Editor
- Built with React Flow for professional node-based UI
- Drag-and-drop interface for building workflows
- Real-time validation and error highlighting
- Auto-layout and organization features

### OpenAI Agent Integration
- Full support for OpenAI Agent SDK
- Configure agents, tools, and handoffs visually
- Structured outputs with Zod schemas
- Token usage tracking and cost monitoring

### MCP Server Support
- Discover and browse available MCP servers
- List tools from each server
- Configure tool parameters visually
- Handle OAuth authentication flows
- Execute tools within workflows

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Slack approval nodes with interactive components
- Custom approval UI with rich formatting
- Timeout handling and escalation
- Approval history and audit trail

### Continuous Execution
- Background job processing with job queues
- Cron-based scheduling for recurring workflows
- Webhook triggers for external events
- Event-driven execution model
- Comprehensive retry logic

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Flow + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Fastify (high-performance Node.js framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Job Queue**: Bull/BullMQ with Redis
- **AI**: OpenAI Agent SDK
- **Integration**: MCP protocol support
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend + serverless functions)

## Security Features

- JWT authentication for API access
- Encrypted secret storage
- Sandboxed workflow execution
- Resource limits and timeouts
- CORS and rate limiting
- Audit logging for all operations

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Complete frontend UI components
2. Build backend API server
3. Implement execution engine
4. Add node type handlers
5. Integrate MCP servers
6. Test end-to-end workflows

## Integration with Existing System

The agent builder seamlessly integrates with the existing codebase:
- Reuses `@agents/db` for database operations
- Leverages `@agents/core` utilities (PII masking, logging, validation)
- Uses existing Slack integration from `apps/slack-bot`
- Follows established architectural patterns
- Compatible with current OpenAI agent implementations

## Success Metrics

- **Usability**: Create first workflow in <10 minutes
- **Performance**: Execute simple flows in <5 seconds
- **Reliability**: >99% execution success rate
- **Adoption**: 50+ active workflows within 3 months
