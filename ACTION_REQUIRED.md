# 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED: Apply Database Migration

**Status:** End-to-end testing **BLOCKED** - Tables don't exist in Neon

---

## 📊 Current Test Results

Just tested your production deployment:

### ✅ What's Working

- Database connection: ✅ Connected to Neon (1.3s latency)
- Health endpoint: ✅ Working perfectly
- OpenAI: ✅ Configured and validated
- Slack: ✅ Configured and validated
- Code: ✅ All optimizations in place

### ❌ What's Blocking

- **Database tables don't exist**
- Error: `relation "tickets" does not exist`
- Impact: **ALL webhooks failing**

---

## 🎯 YOUR ACTION: Apply Migration (Choose One)

### Option 1: Neon Console (FASTEST - 2 minutes) ⚡

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Open Neon Console**
   - Go to: https://console.neon.tech/
   - Login with your Neon account

2. **Select Your Database**
   - Find the database connected to Vercel
   - Should be: `ep-dark-voice-a2tfhnpy-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech`

3. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Or find "Query Editor" tab

4. **Copy the Migration SQL**
   - Open file: `/Users/bigmac/projects/agents/packages/db/migrations/apply-to-neon.sql`
   - Select all (Cmd+A)
   - Copy (Cmd+C)

5. **Run the SQL**
   - Paste into Neon SQL Editor (Cmd+V)
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter
   - Wait for completion (~2 seconds)

6. **Verify Success**
   You should see output like:
   ```
   table_name    | column_count
   --------------+-------------
   drafts        |           7
   human_reviews |           7
   tickets       |           7
   ```

**Done!** ✅

### Option 2: Command Line (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/bigmac/projects/agents

# 2. Get your DATABASE_URL
# Find it in: https://vercel.com/elaway/agents/settings/environment-variables
# Or in Neon Console

# 3. Export the URL (temporary)
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@ep-xxx.neon.tech:5432/database?sslmode=require"

# 4. Run the migration script
./scripts/apply-production-migration.sh

# 5. Follow prompts and confirm
```

---

### Option 3: Drizzle Kit (Developer Method)

```bash
cd /Users/bigmac/projects/agents

# Get DATABASE_URL from Vercel or Neon
export DATABASE_URL="your-connection-string"

# Navigate to db package
cd packages/db

# Run migration
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate

# Verify with Studio
pnpm db:studio
```

---

## ✅ After Migration: Verification

### 1. Test Health Endpoint (Immediate)

```bash
curl https://agents-elaway.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Should return:**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "latency_ms": 45
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Trigger HubSpot Test

Create a test ticket in HubSpot to trigger your workflow.

**Check Vercel logs for:**

```
✅ Database connection string resolved
✅ Starting email processing
✅ Created ticket via fallback: ticket_id=xxx
✅ Created draft via fallback: draft_id=yyy
✅ Email processing completed successfully
```

### 3. Check Neon Database

In Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
-- View created tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Check ticket was created
SELECT * FROM tickets ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check draft was created
SELECT * FROM drafts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### 4. Check Slack (If Configured)

Look for a message in your SLACK_REVIEW_CHANNEL with:

- 🤖 Draft Review Required
- Confidence score
- Draft text
- Action buttons

## 📞 When You're Done

**Let me know you've applied the migration, and I'll:**

1. ✅ Re-test the health endpoint
2. ✅ Verify database connectivity
3. ✅ Help you test a webhook
4. ✅ Confirm end-to-end flow works
5. ✅ Document the complete test results

## 💡 Why This Is Safe

The SQL I created:

- ✅ Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - won't overwrite existing tables
- ✅ Uses `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION` - handles duplicate constraints gracefully
- ✅ Wrapped in transaction (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) - all or nothing
- ✅ Matches your existing migration file exactly
- ✅ Includes verification query at the end

**No risk of data loss or conflicts.**

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- **Option 1 (Neon Console):** 2 minutes
- **Option 2 (Command Line):** 5 minutes
- **Option 3 (Drizzle Kit):** 5 minutes

**Choose Option 1** - it's the fastest and most straightforward.
