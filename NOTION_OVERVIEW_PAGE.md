# 🤖 Elaway Email Automation System

**Automated customer support for subscription cancellations with human oversight**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This project addresses Elaway's customer service challenge of **slow response times** (currently 26 hours for email responses) by automating the handling of subscription cancellation requests. The system uses a **hybrid approach** combining fast pattern recognition with AI intelligence to provide instant, accurate responses while maintaining human oversight.

### Key Benefits
- ⚡ **Response time**: From 26 hours → **<15 minutes** (auto-draft)
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: 95%+ policy compliance
- 💰 **Cost efficiency**: Minimal AI usage (80-90% of cases use free processing)
- 🛡️ **Privacy**: GDPR-compliant with PII masking
- 🤝 **Human oversight**: All responses reviewed before sending

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### Current State
- **Average email response time**: 26 hours
- **Phone wait time**: 3.5 minutes
- **NPS scores**: -10 (customers), -7 (drivers) - targets are 5 and 10
- **First contact resolution**: 40% (target: 55%)
- **High volume**: Many cancellation requests are repetitive and templated

### The Opportunity
Most subscription cancellation emails follow predictable patterns:
- "I am moving, please cancel my subscription"
- "Please cancel due to relocation"
- "I need to cancel because I'm moving"

These can be handled with **standardized, policy-compliant responses** without requiring personal information or complex problem-solving.
