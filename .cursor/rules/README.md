# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains project-specific rules for Cursor AI in modern `.mdc` format.

## How Rules Work

### Always Applied Rules

Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are included in every AI request.

### Auto-Attached Rules

Rules with glob patterns are automatically included when working with matching files.

### Nested Rules

Rules in subdirectories (`apps/agent/.cursor/rules/`, etc.) automatically apply when working in those directories.

## Creating New Rules

### From Cursor Settings

1. Open `Cursor Settings > Rules`
2. Click `New Cursor Rule`
3. Choose rule type (Always, Auto-Attached, Agent Requested, Manual)
4. Write rule content in MDC format
5. Save to `.cursor/rules/`

### From Chat

Use `/Generate Cursor Rules` command to create rules from conversations.

## MDC Format

```mdc
---
description: Clear, one-line description
globs: path/to/files/**/*.ts, other/path/**/*.js
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Title

## Section

Content with examples, DO/DON'T patterns, and references to other files.

@filename - Reference files
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep rules focused** - Each rule covers one specific area
2. **Use glob patterns** - Scope rules to relevant files
3. **Provide examples** - Include DO and DON'T code examples
4. **Reference files** - Link to relevant files using `@filename`
5. **Update regularly** - Keep rules current with team decisions

## Viewing Active Rules

Active rules are shown in the **Agent sidebar** during Chat or Inline Edit:

- ‚úÖ Always-applied rules (green)
- üìé Auto-attached rules (blue)
- üìÅ Nested rules (yellow)
