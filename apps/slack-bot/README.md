# Slack Bot

HITM review flow: Approve/Reject/Edit interactive messages and modals.

This package provides the `postReview` function for posting draft reviews to Slack channels. All interactive components (buttons, modals) are handled by the serverless interactions endpoint at `api/slack/interactions.ts`.
