# Agents Platform Overview

The Agents monorepo powers Elaway's automated handling of HubSpot cancellation tickets. The system routes
every inbound customer email through a **hybrid deterministic/AI pipeline** that balances reliability,
cost, and quality:

- **Deterministic first** via pattern matching for standard cancellations
- **AI fallback** (OpenAI GPT-4o) for ambiguous or edge-case messages
- **Human-in-the-middle (HITM)** review in Slack for final approval

The architecture is optimized around privacy-safe processing, policy compliance, and rapid manual
intervention when needed. This documentation uses the [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) framework and is
organized to mirror the codebase hierarchy.

## Key Repositories

- `api/` – Serverless webhooks deployed to Vercel
- `apps/agent/` – Hybrid processor entrypoint and supporting modules
- `apps/slack-bot/` – Slack reviewer workflow and interactions
- `packages/` – Shared libraries: core utilities, prompts, database schema

Continue to the next section for a detailed look at the hybrid processor flow.
